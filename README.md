# 🌺 T~YÁX✨M’s Web Dev Journey

Hey there 👋🏽  
I’m **T~YÁX✨M**, a curious mind taking her first steps into the world of **Web Development**.  
I’m currently learning:
- 🧱 **HTML** – the structure  
- 🎨 **CSS** – the style  
- ⚡ **JavaScript** – the magic  

💡 *Every code I write is a whisper of creativity and curiosity.*  

Stay tuned for my small projects, practice codes, and design experiments as I grow in this space! 🌱
